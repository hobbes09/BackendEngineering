The **Secure Shell (SSH) protocol** and the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** are both integral parts of network communication, but they serve different purposes.

[**SSH** is a cryptographic network protocol that provides secure communication between networked devices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/)[1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). [It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). [SSH is often used for controlling servers remotely, for managing infrastructure, and for transferring files](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/)[1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/). [It encrypts data so that someone trying to intercept the message cannot read what’s being sent](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/)[3](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/). [They only know that data is being transmitted across and how frequently it’s happening](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/)[3](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/).

On the other hand, **TCP** is a core protocol of the Internet protocol suite. [It operates at a lower level than SSH and is used to establish reliable connections and ensure data integrity](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/)[1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/). [TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that both computers verify a connection before data is sent](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/)[3](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/). [This keeps data from being sent out of order or in pieces](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/)[3](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/). [TCP connection is established through a three-way handshake](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/)[3](https://www.thruinc.com/blog/what-is-ssh/).

The key difference between SSH and TCP is that SSH is an application-level protocol that provides a secure channel, while TCP is a transport-level protocol that ensures reliable transmission of data. [SSH actually runs on top of TCP, using TCP’s reliable transmission of data to provide a secure communication channel](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/)[1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/).

In summary, while TCP is responsible for establishing connections and ensuring data integrity, SSH is used to secure these connections and protect the data being transmitted. Both protocols play crucial roles in secure and reliable network communication.
